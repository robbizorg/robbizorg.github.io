"What is compensation in vocal training?","Compensation is when we consciously try to achieve some vocal goal but lack the coordination or feel we lack it. As a result, the body recruits muscles it doesn't need, just to force the goal to be achieved, often leading to unhelpful and hard-to-change habits."
"What drives vocal compensation?","Compensation in vocal training is driven by a lack of awareness and effort, with many attempts to reduce it being passive awareness; it's about knowing what is happening and drawing attention to it, not trying too hard to change it."
"What are common compensations in training?","Common compensations in singing include strain, tension and fatigue, breathiness, and buzzy or rattle-like sounds (FVF or hyperadduction)."
"What is conflation in vocal training?","Conflation is when we confuse or link together similar vocal concepts or sounds, often due to a misunderstanding of how something sounds, which leads to ineffective vocal practices."
"What are common conflations in vocal training?","Common vocal conflations include pitch and resonance, pitch and tension, pitch and breathiness, closure and tension, resonance and tongue root."
"What is pitch-resonance conflation?","Pitch-resonance conflation occurs when we either try to raise pitch but larynx raises/resonance raises instead, try to change resonance but pitch changes, or both pitch and resonance change when trying to modify only one."
"Is a small amount of pitch-resonance conflation normal?","A small amount of pitch-resonance conflation is normal and necessary for vocal naturalness, but if it's completely involuntary it can get in the way of training and reduce pitch and resonance range."
"Why can pitch-resonance conflation be problematic?","Pitch-resonance conflation can be problematic because trying to do high resonance training or voice exercises can lead to a reduced resonance range due to involuntary changes between voiced and unvoiced sounds."
"What are vocal covers?","Vocal covers are features of voice that are unintended and usually mute or otherwise impede the intended function or sound."
"What is tongue root retraction?","Tongue root retraction is associated with a slightly dark quality in voice, sounding as if something is stuck in the throat, achieved by moving the base of the tongue backward."
"Which characters are known for tongue root retraction?","Stitch, Kermit, and Meatwad are associated with tongue root retraction."
"What is Low IA Hollowness?","Low IA Hollowness occurs when IA closure voices become hollow, losing their harmonic power and brightness, sounding similar to M2/falsetto."
"What is nasality in voice?","Nasality occurs when air is let through the nasal passage on sounds that don't need this. It sounds honky if there are nasal sounds in phrases that don't require nasal sounds."
"How can you test for nasality?","You can test for nasality by saying a phrase that doesn't contain nasal sounds like M, N, or NG, and pinching the nose; if it sounds honky, it is nasal."
"What are subharmonics?","Subharmonics sound similar to creak or vocal fry but are more harmonic and less like random noise. They result from vocal fold tension/constriction and too much closure for the level of pressure/airflow."
"What is unique about subharmonics?","Subharmonics present as 'extra harmonics' or duplicated vocal fold cycles and can sound like there are two voices at once. They can indicate a battle between air that wants to leave and vocal folds that are too tight."
"In what way can subharmonics be used in singing?","Subharmonics can be used in singing to hit lower notes or as a stylistic choice, such as in certain types of overtone singing."
"What is subglottal resonance?","Subglottal resonance pertains to the resonance chambers below the glottis in the airway and the resonance frequencies that occur when the glottis is open or closed."
"How does the state of the glottis affect resonance frequency?","When the glottis is closed, it effectively halves the length of the vocal tract, which could double the resonance frequency. However, in practical voice usage, this effect is minimal."
"What is the significance of the change in resonance frequency when the glottis is closed?","The change in resonance frequency with a closed glottis is small and not typically useful in practice. Closed glottis during speech can lead to breathiness and a darker voice quality."
"How does the frequency of F1 change with a closed glottis?","The frequency of the F1 with closed glottis is approximately 87-93% of the frequency with an open glottis, indicating a slight increase in resonance frequency."
"What is unique about subglottal resonance frequencies?","Subglottal resonance frequencies are relatively unique to each individual and don't change during speech, which allows them to potentially be used as a way to fingerprint voices."
"What is a formant?","A formant is a highlighted area of the voice due to resonance effects, emphasizing certain frequency ranges."
"What makes up the voice in relation to formants?","The voice is made up of a fundamental frequency (pitch) and many harmonics, which are shaped by the filter effect of resonance into formants."
"How is a formant frequency range determined?","Formant frequencies are determined by the peaks of resonance within the vocal tract, which is not a perfectly smooth tube, resulting in ranges rather than single frequencies."
"How are formants typically labeled?","Formants are labeled with an 'F' followed by a number, with F0 being the fundamental frequency, F1 the first formant, and so forth."
"Does nasal resonance change the labeling of formants?","Nasal resonance may join the F1 and F2, but it does not renumber existing formants. The 'old' F3 is still called F3, even if it seems there are fewer formants below it due to the joined F1 and F2."
"What is Pharyngeal Constriction?","Pharyngeal constriction is the tightening of the throat between the larynx and the mouth, which can occur from trying to maximize resonance or raise the larynx, often leading to tension if done regularly."
"Why is Pharyngeal Constriction usually not ideal?","Pharyngeal constriction can lead to tension habits, it usually comes from compensation and is not ideal for voice modulation."
"What is Vocal Size?","Vocal Size refers to the intuitive perception of resonance and pitch based on the imagined physical size of a speaker, such as a giant's booming voice versus a pixie's bright tone."
"How does Vocal Size relate to character voices?","Vocal Size describes the expected sound from a character based on their physical stature, aiding in understanding and visualizing the voice's resonance and pitch."
"What is Articulation in speech?","Articulation refers to how and how much we move the mouth when speaking, affecting how clear or mumbled our words sound."
"What might cause underarticulation or overarticulation?","Speaking with too little movement results in underarticulation (mumbling), while too much movement can lead to overarticulation."
"What is an example of articulation differences in speech?","'Oh my god' can sound like 'uh muh guhd' when underarticulated, or 'ouw mai gaud' when overarticulated."
"What is Mouth Space?","Mouth space refers to the use of the oral cavity to change resonance and articulation, affecting the perceived pitch and gender of the voice."
"How does mouth space affect voice?","Changing the shape of the mouth and the position of the tongue can modify vowel formants, which influences voice tone and gender perception."
"What are Vowels in terms of resonance?","Vowels are created by changing the first two resonance formants, F1 and F2, which determine their relative position and hence the vowel sound."
"What is a Macro vowel?","A Macro vowel is a slight adjustment in mouth shape to shift a vowel towards 'a' or 'i' to brighten, or towards 'uh' to darken the overall vocal tone."
"What is Larynx Height in voice?","Larynx Height refers to the position of the larynx in the throat, which affects vocal resonance; a higher larynx creates a shorter vocal tract and a higher frequency of resonance."
"What muscles are involved in raising the larynx?","The thyrohyoid and stylohyoid muscles are involved in raising the larynx. The thyrohyoid is mainly responsible for this action."
"What happens when the larynx is raised?","Raising the larynx shortens the vocal tract, which can result in a brighter voice with a higher frequency of resonance."
"What is Resonance in voice?","Resonance in voice refers to how the vocal tract affects the sound passed through it, acting as a filter to highlight or reduce the sound."
"What is Brightness in voice?","Brightness in voice is a combination of the tone and resonance, characterized by more high-frequency harmonics."
"How can a voice be both resonant and dark?","A voice can have substantial high-frequency harmonics (brightness) yet sound dark due to low clarity, breathiness, nasality, or low laryngeal adjustments."
"What are Onsets in voice?","Onsets are the beginning of the voiced sound, where the vocal cords' configuration starts the voice."
"What are Soft Onsets?","Soft onsets occur when the vocal folds start open and come together as the air starts flowing, leading to a smooth voice onset without a change in volume."
"What are Hard Onsets?","Hard onsets happen with the vocal folds starting closed and with pressure, making the beginning of the sound creaky or louder than the rest."
"What are Aspirate Onsets?","Aspirate onsets start with the folds open like soft onsets, but they close after the airflow has already begun, giving a breathy or whispery quality to the start of the sound."
"What are Offsets in voice?","Offsets are the very end of the voiced sound, related to how the vocal cords stop vibrating."
"What are Soft Offsets?","Soft offsets occur when the vocal folds close just in time for the pressure to stop, resulting in a smooth and immediate stop of the voice."
"What are Hard Offsets?","Hard offsets happen when the pressure is sustained longer, requiring the folds to press harder to stop the sound, which can lead to a creak or fry."
"What are Aspirate Offsets?","Aspirate offsets involve the folds barely closing as the pressure stops, allowing the sound to fade out smoothly rather than stopping abruptly."
"What is Base Pitch?","Base Pitch is the pitch a voice naturally returns to after intonation, usually the lowest pitch a voice will go to, acting like a vocal 'home position'."
"How can you test Base Pitch?","To test Base Pitch, one can elongate the last word of a phrase, as in 'glaaaaass' instead of 'glass', and the prolonged tone is often the base pitch."
"What are Onsets in voice?","Onsets are the beginning of the voiced sound, where the vocal cords' configuration starts the voice."
"What are Soft Onsets?","Soft onsets occur when the vocal folds start open and come together as the air starts flowing, leading to a smooth voice onset without a change in volume."
"What are Hard Onsets?","Hard onsets happen with the vocal folds starting closed and with pressure, making the beginning of the sound creaky or louder than the rest."
"What are Aspirate Onsets?","Aspirate onsets start with the folds open like soft onsets, but they close after the airflow has already begun, giving a breathy or whispery quality to the start of the sound."
"What are Offsets in voice?","Offsets are the very end of the voiced sound, related to how the vocal cords stop vibrating."
"What are Soft Offsets?","Soft offsets occur when the vocal folds close just in time for the pressure to stop, resulting in a smooth and immediate stop of the voice."
"What are Hard Offsets?","Hard offsets happen when the pressure is sustained longer, requiring the folds to press harder to stop the sound, which can lead to a creak or fry."
"What are Aspirate Offsets?","Aspirate offsets involve the folds barely closing as the pressure stops, allowing the sound to fade out smoothly rather than stopping abruptly."
"What is Base Pitch?","Base Pitch is the pitch a voice naturally returns to after intonation, usually the lowest pitch a voice will go to, acting like a vocal 'home position'."
"How can you test Base Pitch?","To test Base Pitch, one can elongate the last word of a phrase, as in 'glaaaaass' instead of 'glass', and the prolonged tone is often the base pitch."
"What are False Vocal Folds?","The false vocal folds, also known as ventricular folds, are located above the true vocal folds and can sometimes interrupt normal phonation, causing subharmonics or used as compensation for inadequate closure or atrophied vocal folds."
"Are False Vocal Folds damaging to the voice?","False vocal folds are not particularly damaging to the voice, but they can be more of an annoyance or a sign of another problem."
"What kind of sound do False Vocal Folds produce?","False vocal folds typically cause a rough, buzzy overtone, or a 'rattle' sound, and can create aperiodic sounds in the 8000 to 15,000hz range, similar to vocal fry but in the 10khz range."
"What are Arytenoids?","Arytenoids can vibrate if the pharynx is constricted enough, contributing to some metal singing distortion and for sounds like the crow caw sound."
"How do Arytenoids contribute to phonation?","Arytenoids allow for vibration when the pharynx is constricted, enabling certain types of vocal distortion that are used in metal singing and similar sounds."
"What is belting in singing?","Belting is a singing technique that allows a singer to hit higher notes without blending with M2 (falsetto). It involves increasing air pressure, vocal fold mass, and closure to produce a kind of controlled yelling."
"When should one learn belting?","It is advised not to learn belting until M2 blending is somewhat mastered, as belting can drastically cut down the top of the pitch range and make vocal weight harder to control."
"What are the risks of incorrect belting technique?","Incorrect belting can cause a drastic cut in the pitch range, make vocal weight harder to control, and possibly lead to atrophy of the ability to do M2 if it's the only method used for hitting high notes."
"What is the proper way to approach belting?","Proper belting requires a balance of elements such as air pressure, vocal fold mass, and closure, and should not simply be louder or strained. Proper technique avoids compensation and strain."
"What is Belt Blend?","Belt Blend is the technique of blending belting with M2 (falsetto) to some extent. It's a careful balance that requires knowledge about how to do it, which is not widely known."
"How might one achieve a Belt Blend?","Belt Blend might be achieved by reducing TA (thyroarytenoid muscle tension) while balancing CT (cricothyroid muscle tension), maintaining or increasing closure, and slightly reducing air pressure."
"What is the function of the Cricothyroid (CT) muscle?","The Cricothyroid (CT) muscle is responsible for raising the pitch by tilting the thyroid cartilage (the shield-like cartilage of the larynx) and thereby stretching the vocal folds."
"What does Range Expansion refer to in vocal training?","Range Expansion refers to the process of expanding the pitch range in which one can sing or speak. There are two main goals: expanding the comfortable speaking range and expanding the overall phonation range. It requires different approaches than reaching the absolute highest note one can achieve."
"What is Pitch Matching in music?","Pitch Matching is the ability to replicate a note you hear. It can be learned and improved through practice, and one can use a tone generator or a virtual keyboard or synth or DAW to practice it."
"What is Beating in terms of sound frequency?","Beating occurs when two notes of very close frequencies are played together, resulting in interference. This interference can create a 'ghost note' at a frequency that is the difference between the two original notes due to the wave peaks adding together or cancelling each other out."
"What is the Thyroarytenoid (TA) muscle's function?","The Thyroarytenoid (TA) muscle controls the lowering of pitch by contracting the vocal folds, contributing to fold vibratory mass. It works in conjunction with the CT (Cricothyroid muscle) to control pitch, tension, and closure for a fuller sound."
"What is M1 (modal voice) in vocal mechanisms?","M1, also known as the modal voice, is the normal speaking register. The folds get more complete contact (closure), especially the IA and the ligament vibrations as well as the mucosa and some of the muscle (the TA)."
"What is M2 (falsetto) in vocal mechanisms?","M2, or falsetto, is a voice register where the mucosa and ligament vibrate at least less full than M1. This usually has only the mucosa and ligament vibrating off each much less of the muscle and ligament than in M1."
"What is M2 Blending (mix voice)?","M2 Blending is the process of mixing M1 and M2 registers to negate the break and smoothly transition. This is desired because it assumes that parts of the voice are 'shut off,' particularly by maintaining closure (IA) and reducing larynx mass to reduce the imbalance that would cause the break."
"What is M3 (whistle register)?","M3 is the whistle register. It's a high-frequency vocal register that can be dangerous and should only be attempted with proper supervision and instructions."
"What is M0 (vocal fry register)?","M0, or vocal fry register, is at the very bottom of the voice range, often used to extend range but with enough tone to avoid a casual separation of vocal cords. It is characterized by a rattling sound due to loose and airy closure, often caused by not being able to vibrate the folds at very low pitches."
"What defines the Vocal Break mechanism?","The Vocal Break occurs due to an imbalance in fold vibratory mass / vocal weight. It is often marked by cracks, breaks, or instabilities and can happen when transitioning between vocal registers."
"What is Creak in vocal mechanisms?","Creak is a vocal style typically caused by airflow mechanics at a pitch higher than where M0 is forced to happen, resulting in a distinct, creaky sound."
"What is Fry Mix in vocal mechanisms?","Fry Mix is a combination of vocal mechanisms for stylistic reasons, often resulting in a smoother voice pitch, such as blending the lower pitches of M0 (fry) into a smoother mix with M1."
"What is Hyperadduction and its potential effects?","Hyperadduction is the extreme pressing together of the vocal folds, which can irreparably damage them, leading to nodules and a buzzy, high-frequency 'rattle' sound. It's usually evident when the voice reaches 8000 to 15,000hz harmonics, and should be avoided as it can cause pain and more serious vocal issues."
"What is Vocal Fold Constriction and its consequences?","Vocal Fold Constriction occurs when the vocal folds are tensed or constricted, causing a loss of clarity, instability, more creak, and subharmonics. It can result from excessive muscle tension between the adductors and abductors, or an imbalance such as high LCA vs low IA."
"What are Lateral Cricoarytenoids (LCA) and their function?","The LCA muscles adduct (push together) the vocal folds mostly in the middle, enabling phonation by putting the folds in the path of air pressure to vibrate. Without interarytenoid (IA) activity, closure is incomplete and can be unstable. The thyroarytenoid (TA) muscle also contributes to fold closure and medialization."
"What are Interarytenoids (IA) and their function?","IA muscles increase closure at the back of the vocal folds and provide stability. If the voice is unstable or has an airy leak, it may indicate a lack of IA activity. IA activity can't be controlled or felt directly, but it can be improved with relaxed, steady tone and good support."
"What is Low IA Air Leak?","A Low IA Air Leak occurs when there is an air leak due to low IA activity, especially when other adduction is normal. Even if the LCA is functioning correctly or is overcompensating by being more adducted, it can lead to vocal instability."
"What is Low IA Hollowness?","Low IA Hollowness is characterized by a hollow sound in the voice, losing harmonic power and brightness, making the voice sound similar to M2 or falsetto when IA closure is low."
"What is breathiness in voice?","Breathiness occurs when voices are low in closure, allowing air to pass through without directly helping the vocal folds vibrate. It is usually caused by low lateral cricoarytenoid (LCA) and interarytenoid muscle activity."
"What is closure in vocal terms?","Closure refers to the closing of the vocal folds, which allows for air pressure to push them open, resulting in phonation. High closure means the folds come together more completely; low closure means they come together incompletely or with not enough contact."
"Can you feel closure in your voice?","No, you cannot feel closure. If you think you can feel it, there's likely something wrong, such as muscle tension or strain."
"What is a loss of closure?","A loss of closure happens when there is tension in the folds but they do not close, allowing only air to pass without the tension lengthwise to be vibrated. It is often due to too much tension and should not be forcibly avoided."
"What can a loss of closure indicate?","A loss of closure often indicates too much tension in the vocal folds, which can affect range and might cause hyperadduction. It is usually best to relax instead."
"Why is tension bad for high notes in singing?","Excessive tension can cause the student to either press harder and keep tensing up, losing closure. It is not a lack of effort but an excess of tension that prevents high pitches."
"What is vocal damage and disorder?","Abnormal glottal function caused by damage to features of the glottis, notary the vocal folds, or from behavioral issues like MTD (Muscle Tension Dysphonia)."
"What can atrophy in the vocal muscles lead to?","Atrophy can lead to the muscles losing some of their ability to activate due to very long periods of disuse, which is often reversible with effort."
"What are common points of atrophy in the vocal muscles?","Common points of atrophy are the Abductor (cricothyroid) muscles and TA muscles."
"What are vocal nodules?","Nodules are hardened scar-like or callous-like tissue which forms on the edge of the vocal folds after long term damage, often from hyperadduction or constant overuse of function through screaming."
"What is a vocal cyst?","A vocal cyst is a rounded mass on a vocal fold usually as a result of severe and rapid damage and can be permanent."
"What is Muscle Tension Dysphonia (MTD)?","MTD is a condition where muscles outside the larynx, such as the neck, are being tensed when they shouldn't be. This is extraneous muscle tension. Secondary is when muscles in the larynx are tensing in direct opposition to each other."
"What should one do if experiencing muscle tension in the voice?","If muscle tension causes significant enough fatigue or inability to speak, it is advisable to see a Speech Language Pathologist (SLP)."
"What is a vocal polyp?","A vocal polyp is a lesion on a vocal fold similar to a blister."
"What does SOVTES stand for?","Semi Occluded Vocal Tract Exercises."
"What is the goal of SOVTES?","They provide opportunities to train the voice in various fundamental ways, mostly helping with clarity, reducing strain and tension, stability, and closure."
"How should SOVTES be performed?","They should be done in a relaxed way and not pushed, avoiding setting arbitrary goals like 'hit this specific note'."
"What is the mechanism behind SOVTES?","They work by partially blocking the airway above the folds, such as at the lips, which causes backpressure on the folds, acting as a kind of air cushion."
"Give an example of a SOVTE.","Lip Trills - Vibrating the lips, which can be described as 'idling motorcycle'."
"What does the 'SH' sound in SOVTES represent?","When the 'SH' sound is voiced, it becomes the 'J' sound."
"How does lung pressure affect vocal fold vibratory mass?","When we speak, the pressure from the lungs can be used up by the vocal folds coming together like a valve (closure), or by the pressure needed to push more mass out of the way. More pressure with normal closure encourages more vibratory mass or vocal weight."
"What results from more air pressure in terms of vocal fold vibration?","More air pressure leads to more vocal fold vibratory mass or vocal weight, provided there is enough closure."
"What does 'pushing' indicate in vocal terms?","'Pushing' refers to applying more air pressure during phonation, which can lead to an increase in vocal fold vibratory mass or vocal weight."
"What is Vocal Weight?","Vocal Weight is a sound quality associated with low pitch, masculine voices. It can sound 'rumbly' or 'heavy' and is linked with pitch. Higher pitches demand lighter vocal weight."
"What does Overfull mean in vocal terms?","Overfull refers to a voice that has too high vocal weight (and usually closure) for and too high resonance. It can result in a buzzy or 'nerdy' sound."
"What does Underfull signify for a voice?","Underfull is when a voice has either too low weight or too low resonance, resulting in a dark or hooty voice."
"What is the role of Falsetto in voice training?","Falsetto, or M2, has extremely light vocal weight and can be used as a guide to a lighter, more efficient voice. While it has qualities that are often not desired, like breathiness or hollowness, it can be a useful interim technique for achieving a lighter vocal weight."
"What is the Quotient in vocal fold dynamics?","Quotient is a measure of how long the vocal folds are open versus closed during a cycle. It's used in research and is closely approximated by other concepts such as vocal weight or active fold mass. This measurement is often done with Electroglottography (EGG)."
"What does Open Quotient (OQ) indicate?","Open Quotient (OQ) indicates how long, as a fraction of a cycle, the vocal folds are open."
"What does Closed Quotient (CQ) represent?","Closed Quotient (CQ) measures how long, as a fraction of a cycle, the vocal folds are closed and resisting air pressure."
"What is 'pushing' in vocal terms?","'Pushing' is when a voice adds more pressure to force a voice to get higher in pitch or louder, which usually results in stress through adding more vocal weight or fold mass and often involves tense or improper closure when it is done as compensation."
"What is belting and how is it related to pushing?","Belting is an example of a pushed configuration in singing. It involves more pressure and more weight to reach higher notes without leaving the modal register (M1)."
"What is pitch naturalisation?","Pitch naturalisation is the process and concept of naturally adjusting a voice to find a balance between pitch and vocal weight, aiming for a sound that does not require much conscious control or effort and is not strained or forced."
"How can a voice be naturalised?","A voice can be naturalised by slightly raising the pitch and allowing the voice to adjust without letting clarity and volume be sacrificed. This can be done both in the short term and long term by raising the base pitch of the voice slightly and speaking for a matter of days or weeks under the right conditions."
"What are the characteristics of naturalised voices?","Naturalised voices sound like the speaker has been speaking at this pitch their whole life, and the voices are sustainable and effortless to produce."
"What are the characteristics of non-naturalised voices?","Non-naturalised voices sound forced or 'pushed', are tiring or require a high level of concentration, and may sound like the speaker is intentionally speaking higher."
"What is an indicator of stress in a voice in terms of pitch?","Stress in a voice can be indicated by a sound quality that seems 'pushed' or 'forced', and if a person's voice tends to go high unintentionally during speech, it's a sign of stress."
"What is base pitch?","Base pitch is the pitch a voice naturally returns to after intonation, determined by vocal weight. It represents the lowest note a voice will go to, and is considered an anchor or 'home position'."
"How can you test your base pitch?","To test your base pitch, read phrases and draw out the last word of each phrase so that it is longer, like saying 'glaaaaaass' instead of 'glass'. The elongated part of the word will usually reveal the base pitch."
"What does VFVM stand for and what does it affect?","Vocal Fold Vibratory Mass (VFVM) is a component of the physical aspects of the vocal folds that influences how much of the folds is vibrating and the surface area in contact during vibration. It affects the sound quality of vocal weight and the vocal quotient."
"What can the contact area between the folds contribute to?","The contact area between the folds, the quotient, and the surface area engaged in creating pressure waves all contribute to the resulting sound quality, similar to how the thickness of a guitar string affects its sound."
"How does VFVM relate to pitch and sound quality?","More VFVM results in a heavier sound quality and a predisposition to low pitch, like a deeper, bassy sound. High vibratory mass causes a 'rumble' at low pitches. Conversely, less VFVM allows for higher pitches to be achieved more easily."
