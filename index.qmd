:::{#about-content}

A girl close to noise.

I'm Robin Netzorg (she/her), a fifth-year PhD student in UC Berkeley's EECS Department, advised by Prof. Gopala Anumanchipalli and Prof. Bin Yu. Research-wise, I'm currently interested in flexible speech synthesis and voice modification, with a particular interest in applying these techniques to build tools for speech therapy and Gender-Affirming Voice Training (GAVT). Previously, I was interested in interpretable machine learning and causal inference, but, well, sometimes you just have to make a drastic life change in the fourth year of your PhD. 

Outside of research, I'm your semi-stereotypical Bay Area <span class="trans_blue">tr</span><span class="trans_pink">an</span><span class="trans_white">s g</span><span class="trans_pink">ir</span><span class="trans_blue">l.</span> I'm into making "music" with my friends, playing video games, reading books, and jotting down thoughts in my journal. Check out my research below or <span class="no-underline">[click here to see whatever it is I've decided to post.](posts.qmd)</span>
